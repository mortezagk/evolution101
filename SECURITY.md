**How to Report a Vulnerability:**

Please report vulnerabilities through one of the following methods:

Please include the following information in your report:

*   A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including any relevant URLs or code snippets.
*   Any other information that could be helpful for us to understand and resolve the issue.

**What to Expect:**

*   We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
*   We will provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability's severity and impact.
*   We will keep you updated on the progress of our investigation and any remediation efforts.
*   We will publicly credit you for your discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous) once the vulnerability has been resolved.

We kindly ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.
